This map is the centerpiece of Eshhad, an online platform that aggregates and collates alleged religious persecution and sectarian attacks in Egypt. The map focuses on incidents of sectarian attacks and violence. The data represents the most comprehensive set tracking this information, detailing the location, players, victims, and responses to each data point. Data is collected from news sources as well as reported by individuals and stored in a Google Docs spreadsheet. This data is loaded live, directly into the map so it displays the most current data on each load.

The design of the map is restrained and sympathetic to the serious subject matter. A small amount of subdued color displays target type and is echoed throughout the UI as users explore the data. The points on the map change state as users interact with them and full details are presented on the sidebar. Users can filter by attribute and by time, as well as explore the temporal narrative in the data using non-map controls.

The map was built using a simple Leaflet implementation and is fully responsive for mobile use. It is hosted on Github pages so changes to the code can quickly be deployed into production.
