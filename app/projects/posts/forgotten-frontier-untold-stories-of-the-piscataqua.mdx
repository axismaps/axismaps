## Project Details
This map was installed as an interactive touchscreen piece in an exhibit at the Old Berwick Historical Society's Counting House Museum, telling the history of settlement in the southern New Hampshire/Maine border region. The map features the stories of a number of important figures and locations in that history, which visitors can explore by tapping them to view associated text and images. Visitors can also explore a georeferenced historical basemap, and compare it to present day by fading between it and a modern basemap.
