Working with [Vandewalle & Associates](http://www.vandewalle.com/), we built an interactive town map as part of the Dekorra Economic Development Opportunities Improvement Initiative. This map, built with the open-source OpenLayers library, combines Google base maps with the town's parcel data to allow users to explore the 3 economic focus zones in the town of Dekorra. The map allows users to search and filter properties based on characteristics such as parcel size and cost and retrieve detailed information and photos for each parcel on-the-fly.
