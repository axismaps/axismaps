This chronology was built to display entries where fine temporal resolution and narrative flow were of key importance. It supports multiple temporal resolutions and date ranges to tell the complex story of the First World War. Data is stored via CSV and can easily be deployed by the editorial staff. This chronology supports filtering and boolean searching to quickly narrow down hundreds of entries.
