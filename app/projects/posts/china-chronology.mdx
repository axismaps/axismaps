We designed and built this chronology of Chinese history (1637-1937) as part of an Adam Matthew Digital project covering the Wason Pamphlet Collection at Cornell University. Users can scroll down the chronology or use the interactive histogram-timeline at the top of the page to jump to a particular year of interest. The chronology can also be filtered down by a range of possible themes (e.g., arts and culture) and is fully text searchable.
