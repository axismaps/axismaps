For this map, we worked with Adam Matthew Digital editorial staff and researchers at the Newberry Library to create a series of maps to provide students a broad overivew of the history and culture of Native Americans. The maps were designed and produced as static maps and then exported to SVG where D3 creates simple interactivity like panning / zooming and data probing. Each map integrates with images from the AIHC collection and entries from the interactive chronology.
