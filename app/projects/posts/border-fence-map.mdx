## Project Details
Popular Mechanics contacted Axis Maps to produce a map to be featured in their 4-page spread for their article titled: 'Fixing the U.S. Border Fence' in their August, 2010 issue. This map shows the location and condition of the U.S. / Mexico border fence and was designed around the page-layout and graphic style of both the article and issue.
