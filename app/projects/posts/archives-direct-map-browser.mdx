## Project Details
This small map was built as an interactive visual gateway to the Archives Direct collection. The user is greeted with an animated spinning globe (orthographic projection) that transforms into a Mollweide projected map on click. The map is linked to a list to allow for quick navigation and multiple selections can be made before submitting the results to a document search.
