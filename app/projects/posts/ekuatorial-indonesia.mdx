## Project Details
We worked with Earth Journalism to produce the cartography for their Ekuatorial Indonesia environmental journalism project. The cartographic design of the basemaps blend seamlessly with their site design and considerable work was done manipulating messy data from multiple sources to create meaningful maps to accompany the news stories.
